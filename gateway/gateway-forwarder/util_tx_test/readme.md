LoRa concentrator packet sender
================================

1. Introduction
----------------

This software is used to send test packets with a LoRa concentrator. The packets
contain little information, on no protocol (ie. MAC address) information but
can be used to assess the functionality of a gateway downlink using other
gateways as receivers.

2. Dependencies
----------------

This program is a typical example of LoRa concentrator HAL usage for sending
packets.

Only high-level functions are used (the ones contained in loragw_hal) so there
is no hardware dependencies assuming the HAL is matched with the proper version
of the hardware.
Data structures of the sent packets are accessed by name (ie. not at a
binary level) so new functionalities can be added to the API without affecting
that program at all.

3. Usage
---------

The application runs until the specified number of packets have been sent.
Press Ctrl+C to stop the application before that.

Use the -h to get help and details about available options.

The payload content is:
[T][E][S][T][packet counter MSB][packet counter LSB] followed by ASCII padding.

All LoRa data is scrambled and whitened, so the padding has no influence
whatsoever on the packet error rate.
